      "1. Identity & Origin": "**Official Names and Aliases**\nThe fund is officially known as the **Armed Forces Flag Day Fund (AFFDF)**, also referred to as the \"Flag Day Fund\" in various contexts. The fund was historically known by different names before its consolidation in 1993.\n\n**Date of Establishment and Legal Basis**\nThe tradition of Armed Forces Flag Day was established on **December 7, 1949**, when the Defence Minister's Committee created the first Flag Day Fund on August 28, 1949[6]. However, the current consolidated **Armed Forces Flag Day Fund (AFFDF)** was formally established through Government of India, Ministry of Defence **Notification No. SRO-7E dated April 13, 1993**[46]. This notification amalgamated four separate welfare funds into a single comprehensive fund.\n\n**Founders and Inaugural Details**\nThe original Flag Day concept was proposed by the Defence Minister's Committee in 1949, following India's independence when the need arose to manage welfare of defence personnel[6]. The first Armed Forces Flag Day was observed on December 7, 1949, marking the beginning of this national tradition of honoring military personnel and collecting public donations for their welfare.\n\n**Governing Body and Structure**\nThe AFFDF is managed by a **Managing Committee with the Hon'ble Raksha Mantri (Defence Minister) as Chairman**[6]. The Vice Chairman is the Hon'ble Raksha Rajya Mantri (Minister of State for Defence), and members include the three Service Chiefs, Defence Secretary, Secretary of Ex-Servicemen Welfare/MoD, and other senior Central government officials[55].\n\nAt the operational level, the **Kendriya Sainik Board (KSB)** serves as the apex administrative body under the Department of Ex-Servicemen Welfare (DESW), Ministry of Defence[8]. The Secretary KSB heads the Secretariat and manages the AFFDF operations[8]. The fund operates through a nationwide network of 34 Rajya Sainik Boards (RSBs) and 413 Zila Sainik Boards (ZSBs)[32].\n\n**Sources:** PIB Press Release, Government Notifications, KSB Official Documents[6][8][46][55]\n\n---",

      "3. Legal & Governance": "**Legal Status and Foundation**\nThe Armed Forces Flag Day Fund operates as a **Government-administered fund** under the Ministry of Defence. The fund's legal foundation rests on the **Government of India, Ministry of Defence Notification No. SRO-7E dated April 13, 1993**[46], which amalgamated four separate welfare funds into the consolidated AFFDF.\n\n**Constituent Funds Amalgamated (1993)**\nThe notification amalgamated the following funds:\n- Amalgamated Special Fund for War Bereaved, War Disabled and other ex-Servicemen/Serving Personnel\n- Flag Day Fund\n- St. Dunstan's (India) and Kendriya Sainik Board Fund  \n- Indian Gorkha Ex-Servicemen's Welfare Fund[46]\n\n**Administrative Framework**\nThe fund operates under the **administrative control of the Ministry of Defence** through the Department of Ex-Servicemen Welfare (DESW).

This creates a two-tiered financial pipeline where AFFDF serves as the collection mechanism, while RMEWF functions as the disbursement vehicle for structured welfare schemes[4].\n\n**Sources:** PIB Press Releases, Economic Times, Parliament Records[4][6][10][13][14][41][43]\n\n---",
