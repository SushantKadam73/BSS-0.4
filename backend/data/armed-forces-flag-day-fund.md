## 1. Identity & Origin

**Official Names and Aliases**
The fund is officially known as the **Armed Forces Flag Day Fund (AFFDF)**, also referred to as the "Flag Day Fund" in various contexts. The fund was historically known by different names before its consolidation in 1993.

**Date of Establishment and Legal Basis**
The tradition of Armed Forces Flag Day was established on **December 7, 1949**, when the Defence Minister's Committee created the first Flag Day Fund on August 28, 1949[6]. However, the current consolidated **Armed Forces Flag Day Fund (AFFDF)** was formally established through Government of India, Ministry of Defence **Notification No. SRO-7E dated April 13, 1993**[46]. This notification amalgamated four separate welfare funds into a single comprehensive fund.

**Founders and Inaugural Details**
The original Flag Day concept was proposed by the Defence Minister's Committee in 1949, following India's independence when the need arose to manage welfare of defence personnel[6]. The first Armed Forces Flag Day was observed on December 7, 1949, marking the beginning of this national tradition of honoring military personnel and collecting public donations for their welfare.

**Governing Body and Structure**
The AFFDF is managed by a **Managing Committee with the Hon'ble Raksha Mantri (Defence Minister) as Chairman**[6]. The Vice Chairman is the Hon'ble Raksha Rajya Mantri (Minister of State for Defence), and members include the three Service Chiefs, Defence Secretary, Secretary of Ex-Servicemen Welfare/MoD, and other senior Central government officials[55].

This creates a two-tiered financial pipeline where AFFDF serves as the collection mechanism, while RMEWF functions as the disbursement vehicle for structured welfare schemes[4].
