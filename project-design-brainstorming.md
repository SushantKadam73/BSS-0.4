# 📌 Bhartiya Sena Seva Website

I am building a website called **Bhartiya Sena Seva**, an **independent aggregator platform** that provides in-depth information on various nation-level **schemes/funds for the Indian Armed Forces**.

## 🎯 Purpose & Positioning

* Not a government portal, but a **research-based guide** that helps citizens discover, learn about, and support authentic government-backed armed forces funds.
* Users can explore detailed fund research (identity, purpose, governance, finances, operations, impact, archives, etc.).
* After exploring, users are redirected to the **official donation portals** for contributions.
* Goal: **Increase awareness, transparency, and citizen participation** in soldier welfare funds.

## 🔑 Core Information Categories (per Fund)

1. Identity & Origin, History
2. Purpose & Beneficiaries
3. Legal & Governance
4. Money Flows & Finance
5. Operations & Distribution
6. Impact & Verification
7. Communications, PR & Fundraising
8. Assets & Archives
9. Technical & Integration
10. Compliance & Risk
11. Fun Facts

* Supplementary content: old news clippings, inauguration photos, family stories, beneficiary showcases, audits, reports.

This information is present in fund_research_reports folder. Each fund has its own research report and we will convert the information present in this for the fund page. 

## 🏗️ Phase One: Core Design, Structure & Development
