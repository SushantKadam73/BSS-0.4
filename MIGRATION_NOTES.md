# Migration to Frontend-Only Architecture

## Changes Made

### âœ… Completed
1. **Moved JSON data files** from `backend/data/` to `frontend/src/data/`
   - `funds.json`
   - `impact_stats.json`
   - `static_data.json`

2. **Updated all page components** to import JSON directly instead of API calls:
   - `HomePage.jsx` - Now imports all data from JSON files
   - `FundDirectoryPage.jsx` - Direct JSON import for funds
   - `AboutPage.jsx` - Loads about content from static_data.json
   - `FundDetailPage.jsx` - Finds fund by slug from local JSON

3. **Removed API dependencies**:
   - Deleted `.env` file (no longer need REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL)
   - Removed `axios` from package.json dependencies
   - Removed all `axios` imports and API calls from components

4. **Updated README** with simplified setup instructions (frontend-only)

### ðŸ”§ Manual Step Required
**Delete the `backend` folder** manually after closing any terminals that might be in that directory.

The folder couldn't be auto-deleted because a process was using it (likely a PowerShell terminal with that working directory).

Steps:
1. Close all terminals that might be in the `backend` directory
2. Manually delete the `backend` folder from File Explorer or run:
   ```powershell
   Remove-Item "C:\Users\susha\OneDrive\Desktop\Projects\BSS 0.4\backend" -Recurse -Force
   ```

## Benefits of This Architecture

âœ… **Simpler deployment** - Just build and deploy the frontend
âœ… **No server costs** - Can host on static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)
âœ… **Faster development** - No need to run two servers
âœ… **Easier maintenance** - Single codebase to manage
âœ… **No Python dependency** - Pure JavaScript/React project

## How to Run

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

That's it! No backend server needed.
