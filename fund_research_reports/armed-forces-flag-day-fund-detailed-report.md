Founders and Inaugural Details
The original Flag Day concept was proposed by the Defence Minister's Committee in 1949, following India's independence when the need arose to manage welfare of defence personnel. The first Armed Forces Flag Day was observed on December 7, 1949, marking the beginning of this national tradition of honoring military personnel and collecting public donations for their welfare.

Governing Body and Structure
The AFFDF is managed by a Managing Committee with the Hon'ble Raksha Mantri (Defence Minister) as Chairman. The Vice Chairman is the Hon'ble Raksha Rajya Mantri (Minister of State for Defence), and members include the three Service Chiefs, Defence Secretary, Secretary of Ex-Servicemen Welfare/MoD, and other senior Central government officials.

At the operational level, the Kendriya Sainik Board (KSB) serves as the apex administrative body under the Department of Ex-Servicemen Welfare (DESW), Ministry of Defence. The Secretary KSB heads the Secretariat and manages the AFFDF operations. The fund operates through a nationwide network of 34 Rajya Sainik Boards (RSBs) and 413 Zila Sainik Boards (ZSBs).
